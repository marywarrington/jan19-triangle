Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?


Excellent commit messages!!
readme is there

Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?
Were branching and looping used effectively?


yes nice work

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?

yes

Is the site user-friendly?

see note about .empty(); but yes.

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

try .empty(); for use in clearing your output without page refresh.
